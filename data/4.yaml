  title: It Makes The Babies Want To Cry - Geroge Clanton
  link: https://soundcloud.com/georgeclanton/george-clanton-it-makes-the-babies-want-to-cry
  description: I love this time of year it's cold outside but you can see the summer on the horizon and with it the pulsing synth pop of this years music that will be powering roof garden playlists. This track is like a mix of mid 00's Friendly Fire-esque kicking drums and the soundscape-ey synth lines of Washed Out. Check out this track if you want a glimpse of Summer!
